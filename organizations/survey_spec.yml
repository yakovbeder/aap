# Alternative: Multiple Choice for Organization Type
# ============================================================================
# If you want to offer predefined organization templates, you can add:
#
#   - question_name: "Organization Type"
#     question_description: "Select a predefined organization type"
#     variable: "org_type"
#     type: "multiplechoice"
#     required: false

#       - "production"
#       - "development"
#       - "testing"
#       - "custom"
#     default: "custom"
#
# Then in the playbook, you could set defaults based on org_type:
#   org_max_hosts: "{{ 500 if org_type == 'production' else 100 }}"
